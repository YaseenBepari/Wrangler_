Prompts Used

1. For understanding the assignment and designing the approach:
Help me understand the Zeotap Wrangler backend assignment. I need to implement a new directive called `aggregate-stats` that can aggregate byte sizes and time durations from multiple columns. It should accept optional output units and aggregation type. What should be my approach?

2. For modifying ANTLR grammar to support BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION:
Here's my existing ANTLR grammar for a custom DSL. I want to add support for BYTE_SIZE (like 10MB, 2.3GB) and TIME_DURATION (like 5s, 3m, 1.5h). Help me update the lexer and parser rules.

3. For implementing the directive logic in Java:
How do I create a new directive in CDAP Wrangler that aggregates multiple byte size or time duration columns, optionally converts the unit, and stores the result in a new column?

4. For converting byte and time units:
Give me utility methods in Java to convert values with units like 'MB', 'GB', 's', 'm', 'h' into bytes and seconds respectively, and back to desired units.


5. For writing unit tests:
Help me write JUnit test cases for a directive that computes the sum, average, max, or min of multiple columns containing time or byte units.
